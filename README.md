# To Write an Article

Here are some key things to know before you start writing an article:

1. **Article Placement:**
   - All articles should be placed in the `content` folder.
   - We use a category system for articles, which means the folder you place your article in depends on its content.

2. **Article Setup:**
   - When starting a new article, feel free to use `template.md` as a starting point.

3. **Image Use:**
   - Make sure to use high-resolution images. If the image is not available in high resolution, you can use this site to improve quality: [https://www.iloveimg.com/upscale-image](https://www.iloveimg.com/upscale-image). Note that this may not always yield the desired result.


# For Developing the Site Further

To test the website locally, run the following commands in the terminal:

```bash
npm i               # Only needs to be run the first time or if after big updates
npm run dev
```

All changes should be testet in dev before merged to main. Feel free to make a branch and work with the chage there before pusing it into dev, but remeber to test things
